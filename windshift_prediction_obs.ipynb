    "Here, we will combine our detection of lake-breeze fronts with obtaining observations and training a Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is:\n",
    "* Download observations for the last year for two airports and other regional sites\n",
    "* Compute a column of \"lake-breeze frontal passage\" by detecting a sudden increase in easterly component of wind - this is what we want to predict\n",
    "* We can use a Random Forest to measure how much the regional observations explain the variance of whether a lake-breeze front passed\n",
    "* In turn, this model could then be used to predict wind shifts by exchanging observations for numerical-guidance values (this may be outside the scope of our work)\n",
